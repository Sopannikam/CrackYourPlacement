Welcome to my GitHub repository for the #CrackYourPlacement challenge! This 45-day challenge, created by Arsh Goyal, focuses on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java.

Overview
This repository contains my solutions to various DSA problems that I'll be tackling over the next 45 days as part of the challenge.

Structure
Daily Solutions: Each day's solutions are organized in folders (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.).
Problem Statements: Each folder includes the problem statements and my approach to solving them.
Code: Java code for each solution with explanatory comments.
